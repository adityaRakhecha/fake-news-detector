Fake NEWS detector using LIAR-PLUS dataset.

In this project, I have used various NLP techniques ( text classification techniques) and four different machine
learning models to classify fake news statements using sci-kit libraries from python.

## Dataset
LIAR-PLUS is a benchmark dataset for fake news detection, released recently. This dataset
has evidence sentences extracted automatically from the full-text verdict report written by
journalists in Politifact. It consists of 12,836 short statements taken from POLITIFACT and
labeled by humans for truthfulness, subject, context/venue, speaker, state, party, and prior
history. For truthfulness, the LIAR dataset has six labels: pants-fire, false, mostly-false,
half-true, mostly-true, and true. These six label sets are relatively balanced in size.

An earlier version of the dataset appeared in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00648.pdf). Earlier Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/thiagorainmaker77/liar_dataset).
